## Overview
Skyscanner’s recommendation system aims to provide users with tailored travel options based on their past behaviors, preferences, and the behavior of similar users. The system supports a better search experience, simplifies travel planning, and drives user engagement by offering relevant suggestions.

## Goals of the Recommendation System
- **Increase Engagement**: Suggest flights, hotels, and destinations that match user preferences.
- **Optimize Search Results**: Improve the relevance of search results through personalized recommendations.
- **Enhance User Retention**: Encourage users to return by providing dynamic recommendations based on changing trends and personal histories.

## Recommendation Algorithms
Skyscanner’s recommendation system leverages multiple approaches for an optimal user experience:

### 1. Collaborative Filtering
This method recommends items based on user interactions and similarities between users. Collaborative filtering uses:
   - **User-Based Filtering**: Finds similar users and recommends items based on their preferences.
   - **Item-Based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to those the user has liked or interacted with before.

### 2. Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering suggests items that are similar to those previously interacted with by the user. For instance, if a user has shown interest in specific destinations or types of flights, the system will recommend similar options.

### 3. Hybrid Approach
Skyscanner combines collaborative and content-based filtering to provide a more holistic recommendation. This hybrid approach ensures that users receive recommendations based on both personal preferences and the collective patterns of similar users.

## Data Collection
To build an effective recommendation system, Skyscanner collects various types of data:
   - **User Demographics**: Age, location, language, and more.
   - **Interaction Data**: Search queries, clicks, bookings, and session details.
   - **User Feedback**: Ratings, reviews, and other forms of feedback.

## User Profile Modeling
The system creates a profile for each user, storing preferences, search history, and interaction data. These profiles help determine which recommendations are most relevant to each user.

## Implementation Details
The recommendation system uses:
   - **Machine Learning** algorithms to identify patterns in user behavior.
   - **Data Preprocessing** to clean and standardize data, ensuring consistent results.
   - **API Integration** to dynamically retrieve data for real-time recommendations.

## Evaluation Metrics
To measure the effectiveness of the recommendation system, Skyscanner uses:
   - **Precision and Recall**: Evaluate the relevance of recommendations.
   - **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Measures user engagement with recommended items.
   - **Conversion Rate**: Tracks the percentage of users who complete bookings based on recommendations.

## Conclusion
The Skyscanner recommendation system enhances user engagement and satisfaction by delivering relevant and personalized travel suggestions. By combining collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and advanced data analytics, Skyscanner continually improves its recommendation engine to meet user needs and optimize the travel search experience.
